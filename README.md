In this project I have used Natural Language Processing to convert text to vectors by firstly breaking the sentences into dictionary of individual words and then using text processing techniques like BOW, TFIDF and Word2Vec to convert this dictionary into a vector. After that I have used various Machine Learning algorithms like SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes etc to detect sentiment of a review.

Also I have used clustering techiques like DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering to cluster positive and negative reviews.
